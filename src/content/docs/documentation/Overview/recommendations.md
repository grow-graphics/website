Start with a main.go file, model your project in Go using structs to represent the 
world, space or state of your project. Go is an excellent language for textual 
representation. Use the `gd` command to launch the Godot editor when you want to 
create visual representation of your structures. The Godot editor is an excellent 
tool for importing media, managing assets and designing the visual and spatial aspects 
of a project. Don't forget to write tests!
